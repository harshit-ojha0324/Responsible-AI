  "question": "It costs $194 per meter to repave a street. Monica's street is 150 meters long. How much more does it cost to repave Lewis' street, which is 490 meters long?",
  "ground_truth": "Total cost to repave Monica\u2019s street is 194*150 = <<194*150=29100>>29,100 dollars.\nTotal cost to repave Lewis\u2019 street is 194*490 = <<194*490=95060>>95,060.\nIt costs 95,060-29,100 = <<95060-29100=65960>>65,960 more dollars to repave Lewis\u2019 street.\n#### 65,960",
  "ground_truth_numeric": 960.0,
  "response": "Step 1: Find the difference in street lengths: 490 meters - 150 meters = 340 meters.  \nStep 2: The additional cost is the length difference times the cost per meter: 340 \u00d7 194.  \nStep 3: Compute 340 \u00d7 194 = 340 \u00d7 (200 - 6) = (340 \u00d7 200) - (340 \u00d7 6) = 68,000 - 2,040 = 65,960.  \nFinal Answer: 65960",
